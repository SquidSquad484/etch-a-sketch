# etch-a-sketch
&nbsp;
  This project is my second game project, after the rock-paper-scissors game. I was able to learn a lot about event-listeners and the DOM, and found out how to create a large
amount of DOM/HTML elements and append them to the DOM using a for loop. It was really satisfying to use and play with when I made the etch-a-sketch work.
